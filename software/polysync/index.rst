Polysync
===========

Polysync does play with ROS

http://docs.polysync.io/flows/getting-started/

It talks to MATLAB
http://docs.polysync.io/articles/development/ecosystem-tools/matlab-and-simulink-toolbox/

Also, it looks like it supports the Puck (along with many other sensors)

http://docs.polysync.io/sensors/velodyne-vlp-16-puck/

All in all it looks like the documentation was well made and it is yet another very useful tool and they claim if we follow their tutorial we can build a self-driving Kia Soul for under $10,000 ( I think this excludes LiDAR and gps etc.) ! Looking through the wiki a bit it looks like the vehicle needs to only slightly be modified.
