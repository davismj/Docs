MPT3
====
* MPT3 is a MATLAB based optimization tool that comes out of The Automatic Controls Laboratory at ETH.
* Lots of other useful software that come out out ETH in Zurich, Switzerland and can be found `aqui <http://control.ee.ethz.ch/research/software.php>`_
* Additionally, I worked with Michal Kvasnica ( a former memeber of The Automatic Controls Laboratory at ETH) developing Moving Obstacle avoidance code using MPT3.

    * The result of this work is a tool named OptiPlan and the code can be found `here <https://bitbucket.org/kvasnica/optiplan/wiki/Home>`_.
