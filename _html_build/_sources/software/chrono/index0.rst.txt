Gazebo
*******


Installation
=============
Automatically installed after following the ROS installation instructions.

Make sure after you install it you source the setup.sh file in the ``.bashrc`` script:
::

  source /usr/share/gazebo-7/setup.sh

Also source any setup.bash scripts that are in your projects:
::

  source /home/febbo/.julia/v0.6/MAVs/workspace/devel/setup.bash

Also in the ``setup.sh`` file in the ``usr/share/gazebo-7/`` directory, add to the resource path if you need to as:
::

  export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-7:/usr/share/gazebo_models:/usr/share/gazebo-7/worlds${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}

In the above example we also added the ``/worlds`` folder.

.. note::

  Using the gui to create models is limited because the default full version of ros kinetic does not let you edit the models after you save them. So, then I started to learn how to make the models directly using XML. The only way to get around this is to build from source but then you won;t be able to use any ROS Ubuntu package related to Gazebo from the ROS deb repo.

From source
------------

To get a stable branch:
::

  /opt$ sudo hg clone https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo /opt/gazebo -b gazebo8

Then try using `checkinstall <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall>`_. Then you can remove it from your system anytime using:
::

  dpkg -r build

In the `/opt/gazebo/build` directory.

Terminology
============

1) Xacro:

  (Xaxro) (XML macros) an XML macro language useful for shorter robot descriptions.

  * xacro:include: import content from another file
  * property: define constants `${property_name}`
  * xacro:macro: include the file where the macro is and call it using the macro's name and filling in the required values


2) `SDFormat <http://sdformat.org/>`_

  An XML format that describes environments for robot simulators visualizations and controls. Originally part of Gazebo but now is stable enough that it stands alone.


Basics
=======

`Model Structure <http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=model_structure&cat=build_robot>`_
----------------------
Make sure that the model is structured correctly. An issue that was ran into is described `here <http://answers.gazebosim.org/question/14249/cant-export-gazebo_model_path/>`_ where I tried to put a model in a lower level directory. Models need to go just below ``catkin/src/``, then ``setup.sh`` must be modifed as:
::

  export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/usr/share/gazebo-7/models:/home/febbo/catkin_ws/src/:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}


`Model State Info <http://answers.ros.org/question/9783/programmatically-get-modelstate-from-gazebo/>`_
---------------------
Using ``rospy`` to get the model states.


World Files
--------------

.. note::

  When saving a world file, put it into the folder with the other world files!
